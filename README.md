# Express-Note-Taking-App

This is a note taking app that allows the user to write and save notes to a JSON file. The user can see and retrieve all of their previous notes on the left hand side and also delete unwanted ones.

We were given starter code for this so the only thing we needed to do is install the dependencies and create the routes for the website to work. This required me reading the documentation before even starting to code because I didn't really understand how to link the frontend with the backend. I was especially confused trying to apply the * in the path for the index page because it wouldn't work if you declared it first. 

My biggest issue was that the page wasn't styling properly and then I realized I forgot I named the style sheet style.css instead of styles.css because I created each file individually and copied the starter code manually rather than copying the files from the class repo into my git folder.
